### What is this repository for? ###

This is a Deep Learning thesis work.Our data source is http://www.oasis-brains.org/ and we have used cross-sectional data.
we have applied Deep Convolutional Neural Networks and trained our model 545 times using GPU. 
Our target was to detect Alzheimer's Disease and we have gained 80.25% accuracy after 545 epochs.
